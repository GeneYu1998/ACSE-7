In this directory you will find the coursework assessment for ACSE-7 in 2019/2020

It consisted of 3 parts: 
* Part-A based on Matthew Piggott's lecture
* Part-B based on Stephan Kramer's 6 lectures
* Part-C based on James Percival's lecture on data assimilation

Each directory also contains some feedback and a description of expected solutions.

Note that this year (2020/2021) there will be four parts with the fourth part
based on the 3 lectures by Rhodri Nelson on FWI, which had to be canceled last
year due to the initial lockdown that happened during ACSE-7.
